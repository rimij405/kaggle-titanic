# Kaggle Competition: Titanic ML

*How can we use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck?*

This project is an attempt to answer the seminal Titanic ML competition hosted by Kaggle, and it serves as a good first-place to apply some of the research we've done to the data.

## Overview

Kaggle puts [this challenge into words](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) best:

> The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
>
> On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
>
> While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
>
> In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Goal

Using the provided [training](data/train.csv) and [testing](data/test.csv) datasets, develop a model that can predict whether or not the passengers on the Titanic survived.
